## üè¥ Submitting Flags for COTD (Challenge of the Day)

To submit your flag for a challenge, use the **COTD25** bot with its slash command:

1. In `#submit-cotd` channel , type:

   ```
   /submit_flag
   ```

2. The command will prompt you for a **flag** input. Enter your flag in the format:

   ```
   cotd{your_answer_here}
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   /submit_flag flag: cotd{hello}
   ```

3. Once submitted, the bot will check if your flag is correct and let you know the result.

### Note
* The flag format is `cotd{}` exactly.

Good Luck!
